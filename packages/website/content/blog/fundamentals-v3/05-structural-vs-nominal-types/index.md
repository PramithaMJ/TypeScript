## Ways of categorizing type systems

Now is a good time to take a step back and think about some conceptual
aspects of types and type systems. How is TypeScript similar and different from Java and JavaScript?

### What is type checking?

Type-checking can be thought of as a task that attempts to evaluate
the question of _compatibility_ or _type equivalence_:

```ts twoslash
// @noImplicitAny: false
const myValue: any = {} as any
/// ---cut---
function foo(x) {
  // ... mystery code ...
}
//
// TYPE CHECKING
// -------------
// Is `myValue` type-equivalent to
//     what `foo` whats to receive?
foo(myValue)
```

This question can be asked at a function call - such as `foo(myValue)` in the above example - as an assignment,

```ts
// is the value y holds type-equivalent to what `x` allows?
x = y
```

...a return,

```ts
const myStrings = ["a"]
/// ---cut---
function bar(): string[] {
  // ...mystery code that might return early...
  //
  //
  // TYPE CHECKING
  // -------------
  // Is `myStrings` type-equivalent to
  //     what `bar` states it will return?
  return myStrings
}
```

or in some other more exotic situations [^1].

### Static vs dynamic

Sorting type systems as either [static](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/basic-types.html#static-type-checking) or dynamic has to do with whether type-checking
is performed **at compile time or runtime**.

> **TypeScript's type system is static.**

Java, C#, C++ all fit into this category. Keep in mind that inferrence can still
occur in static type systems -- TypeScript, Scala, and Haskell all have some form of static type checking.

**Dynamic type systems perform their "type equivalence" evaluation at runtime**. JavaScript, Python,
Ruby, Perl and PHP fall into this category.

### Nominal vs structural

**Nominal type systems are all about NAMES**. Let's take a look at a simple Java example:

```java
public class Car {
  String make;
  String model;
  int make;
}

public class CarChecker {
  // takes a `Car` argument, returns a `String`
  public static String printCar(Car car) {  }
}

Car myCar = new Car();
// TYPE CHECKING
// -------------
// Is `myCar` type-equivalent to
//     what `checkCar` wants as an argument?
CarChecker.checkCar(myCar);
```

In the code above, when considering the question of type equivalence on the last line,
all that matters is whether `myCar` is an instance of the class **named** `Car`.

> TypeScript type system is structural

**Structural type systems are all about STRUCTURE or SHAPE**. Let's look at a TypeScript example:

```ts twoslash
// @strictPropertyInitialization: false
class Car {
  make: string
  model: string
  year: number
  isElectric: boolean
}

class Truck {
  make: string
  model: string
  year: number
  towingCapacity: number
}

const vehicle = {
  make: "Honda",
  model: "Accord",
  year: 2017,
}

function printCar(car: {
  make: string
  model: string
  year: number
}) {
  console.log(`${car.make} ${car.model} (${car.year})`)
}

printCar(new Car()) // Fine
printCar(new Truck()) // Fine
printCar(vehicle) // Fine
```

The function `printCar` doesn't care about which constructor its argument came
from, it only cares about whether it has:

- A `make` property that's of type `string`
- A `model` property that's of type `string`
- A `year` property that's of type `number`

If the argument passed to it meets these requirements, `printCar` is happy.

### Duck typing

"Duck typing" gets its name from the "duck test".

> “If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quack like a duck, then it probably is a duck”.

In practice, this is very similar to structural typing, but "Duck typing" is usually
used to describe dynamic type systems.

### "Strong" vs. "Weak" types

These terms, while used frequently, have no agreed-upon technical definition. In the context of
TypeScript it's common for those who say "strong" to really mean "static".

[^1]: Among these are: generator function `yield`, accessor/mutator-based property conventions.
