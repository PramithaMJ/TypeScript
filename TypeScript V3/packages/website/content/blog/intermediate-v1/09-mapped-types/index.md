Mapped allow types to be defined in other types through a
much more flexible version of an index signature. We'll
study this type in detail, and demonstrate how it makes
language features like indexed access types and conditional
types even more powerful!

## The basics

If you recall the concept of index signatures allow specification
of some value type for an arbitrary key. They're the foundation for
dictionary types in TypeScript:

```ts twoslash
type Fruit = {
  name: string
  color: string
  mass: number
}

type Dict<T> = { [k: string]: T } // <- index signature

const fruitCatalog: Dict<Fruit> = {}
fruitCatalog.apple
//            ^?
```

What if we didn't want _just any key_ to be used to store fruits
in our `fruitCatalog` object, but a specific subset of keys.

You could do this with a map type. We'll stop calling our collection
a `Dict`, since that would imply that we could still use arbitrary keys. Let's
call this a `Record` instead. How about `MyRecord`...

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2339
type Fruit = {
  name: string
  color: string
  mass: number
}

// mapped type
type MyRecord = { [FruitKey in "apple" | "cherry"]: Fruit }

function printFruitCatalog(fruitCatalog: MyRecord) {
  fruitCatalog.cherry
  fruitCatalog.apple
  //            ^?
  fruitCatalog.pineapple
}
```

The thing that _looks like_ an index signature is what makes this a mapped type:

```ts
{ [FruitKey in "apple" | "cherry"]: ... }
```

Let's compare this to a true index signature so that we can see the differences

```ts
{ [nameDoesntMatter: string]: ... }
```

Notice:

- The `in` keyword in the mapped type
- Index signatures can be on _all `string`s_ or _all `number`s_, but not some
  subset of strings or numbers

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 1337
type Fruit = {
  name: string
  color: string
  mass: number
}

/// ---cut---
type MyRecord = { [key: "apple" | "cherry"]: Fruit }
```

### Record

If make our type a bit more generalized with some type params
instead of hardcoding `Fruit` and `"apple" | "cherry"` as shown below,
we'll arrive at a _built-in utility type_ that comes with TypeScript.

```diff
- type MyRecord = { [FruitKey in "apple" | "cherry"]: Fruit }
+ type MyRecord<KeyType, ValueType> = { [Key in KeyType]: ValueType }
```

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 1337
type Fruit = {
  name: string
  color: string
  mass: number
}

/// ---cut---
type MyRecord<KeyType extends string, ValueType> = {
  [Key in KeyType]: ValueType
}
```

Here's the built-in TypeScript type, which matches this pretty much exactly:

```ts
/**
 * Construct a type with a set of properties K of type T
 */
type Record<K extends keyof any, T> = {
  [P in K]: T
}
```

You may notice the `keyof any` difference. As you can see below, it's
just `string | number | symbol`

```ts twoslash
let anyKey: keyof any
//     ^?
```

## Use with indexed access types

Mapped types work _beautifully_ with indexed access types, because
the _index_ can be used when defining the value type.

```ts twoslash
type PartOfWindow = {
  //   ^?
  [Key in
    | "document"
    | "navigator"
    | "setTimeout"]: Window[Key]
}
```

We couldn't have written any equivalent of `Window[Key]` using regular
index signatures. What we end up with, in a sense, is almost as if
**the mapped type loops over all of the possible keys, and determines
the appropriate value type
for each key**

Let's make this a little more generalized through the use of type params.
First, we should let the caller define which keys they'd like to use. We'll call
this type `PickWindowProperties` because we get to specify which things from
`Window` we'd like

```ts twoslash
type PickWindowProperties<Keys extends keyof Window> = {
  [Key in Keys]: Window[Key]
}
// prettier-ignore
type PartOfWindow = PickWindowProperties<
//     ^?
  "document" | "navigator" | "setTimeout"
>
```

Let's generalize it one step further by allowing this type to work on anything,
not just a `Window`. Because this is no longer a type that _exclusively_
works with `Window`, we'll rename this type to `PickProperties`.

```ts twoslash
type PickProperties<
  ValueType,
  Keys extends keyof ValueType
> = {
  [Key in Keys]: ValueType[Key]
}
// prettier-ignore
type PartOfWindow = PickProperties<
//     ^?
  Window,
  "document" | "navigator" | "setTimeout"
>
```

### Pick

We've arrived at another built-in TypeScript utility type: `Pick`. Our `PickProperties`
now matches it exactly (the names of our type params are not of consequence)

```ts
/**
 * From T, pick a set of properties whose keys are in the union K
 */
type Pick<T, K extends keyof T> = {
  [P in K]: T[P]
}
```

```ts twoslash
type PickProperties<
  ValueType,
  Keys extends keyof ValueType
> = {
  [Key in Keys]: ValueType[Key]
}
```

## Mapping modifiers

Following our analogy of mapped types feeling like "looping over all keys",
there are a couple of final things we can do to the properties as we
create each type: set whether the value placed there should be `readonly`
and/or `optional`

This is fairly straightforward, and you can see the use of the
`?` and `readonly` in the three more built-in TypeScript utility
types below.

If there's a `-` to the left of `readonly` or `?` in a mapped type, that
indicates _removal_ of this modifier instead of _application_ of the modifier.

```ts
/**
 * Make all properties in T optional
 */
type Partial<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]?: T[P]
}

/**
 * Make all properties in T required
 */
type Required<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]-?: T[P]
}

/**
 * Make all properties in T readonly
 */
type Readonly<T> = {
  readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P]
}
```

There is no built-in TypeScript "utility type" for `readonly` removal,
but you could implement one if you needed to (not necessarily a good idea though)

```ts twoslash
type NotReadonly<T> = {
  -readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P]
}
```

## Template literal types

TypeScript 4.1 brought with it [template literal types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/template-literal-types.html).

Below you can see an example of how we take three things you
could find in a painting, and four paint colors you could use.

```ts twoslash
type ArtFeatures = "cabin" | "tree" | "sunset"
type Colors =
  | "darkSienna"
  | "sapGreen"
  | "titaniumWhite"
  | "prussianBlue"
```

We can use the **exact same syntax that one would find in an ECMAScript
template literal**,
but in a _type expression_ instead of a _value expression_, to create a new
type that represents every possible combination of these art features and colors

```ts twoslash
type ArtFeatures = "cabin" | "tree" | "sunset"
type Colors =
  | "darkSienna"
  | "sapGreen"
  | "titaniumWhite"
  | "prussianBlue"
/// ---cut---
type ArtMethodNames = `paint_${Colors}_${ArtFeatures}`
//       ^?
```

While something like `"paint_darkSienna_cabin"` could definitely be the
name of a class method in JavaScript or TypeScript, it's more conventional
to use `camelCase` instead of `snake_case`

TypeScript provides a few special types you can use _within these
template literal types_

- `UpperCase`
- `LowerCase`
- `Capitalize`
- `Uncapitalize`

```ts twoslash
type ArtFeatures = "cabin" | "tree" | "sunset"
type Colors =
  | "darkSienna"
  | "sapGreen"
  | "titaniumWhite"
  | "prussianBlue"
/// ---cut---
// prettier-ignore
type ArtMethodNames =
//       ^?
  `paint${Capitalize<Colors>}${Capitalize<ArtFeatures>}`
```

There we go. `paintDarkSiennaCabin` is much more aligned with
what we're used to seeing for function names.

Now, let's bring this back into the world of Mapped Types,
to perform some **key mapping**, where the resultant Mapped Type
has different property names than the type being "iterated over" during the mapping.

Note the use of the `as` keyword in the index signature

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2345
interface DataState {
  digits: number[]
  names: string[]
  flags: Record<"darkMode" | "mobile", boolean>
}

type DataSDK = {
  // The mapped type
  // prettier-ignore
  [K in keyof DataState as `set${Capitalize<K>}`]:
    (arg: DataState[K]) => void
}

function load(dataSDK: DataSDK) {
  dataSDK.setDigits([14])
  dataSDK.setFlags({ darkMode: true, mobil: false })
}
```

If you've ever written data layer code, where often there are defined
types available, and potentially you have a lot of `is*`, `get*` and `set*`
methods, you're probably starting to see how Mapped Types have the potential
to provide rich validation across a wide range of data models.

## Filtering properties out

We've already seen how we could filter properties out of a mapped
type, if the filter condition is based on the _key_.

Here's an example using `Extract` and a template literal type
to filter for only those members of `window.document` that begin with `"query"`:

```ts twoslash
type DocKeys = Extract<keyof Document, `query${string}`>
type KeyFilteredDoc = {
  //   ^?
  [K in DocKeys]: Document[K]
}
```

But what if we needed to filter by _value_? To put this another way,
what if we wanted things to be included or excluded from our mapped type
based on `Document[K]`?

Our solution has to do with `never` and conditional types.

**Here we're using a flawed approach**, where we set the "type of the value"
to `never` whenever
we want to skip it. This is going to leave us with a type that still has 100%
of the keys that `Document` has, with many many values of type `never`

```ts twoslash
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT TO DO. DO NOT FOLLOW THIS EXAMPLE //
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
type ValueFilteredDoc = {
  //   ^?
  [K in keyof Document]: Document[K] extends (
    ...args: any[]
  ) => Element | Element[]
    ? Document[K]
    : never
}

function load(doc: ValueFilteredDoc) {
  doc.querySelector("input")
  //    ^?
}
```

Click Try and poke at this code in the TypeScript playground. While we're kind of
"blocked" from using the things we tried to omit in our mapped type, this
is quite messy.

> A better approach, which will get us a much cleaner result is to filter
> our keys first and then use those keys to build a mapped type

```ts twoslash
// Get keys of type T whose values are assignable to type U
type FilteredKeys<T, U> = {
  [P in keyof T]: T[P] extends U ? P : never
}[keyof T] &
  keyof T

type RelevantDocumentKeys = FilteredKeys<
  Document,
  (...args: any[]) => Element | Element[]
>

type ValueFilteredDoc = Pick<Document, RelevantDocumentKeys>
//    ^?

function load(doc: ValueFilteredDoc) {
  doc.querySelector("input")
  //    ^?
}
```
